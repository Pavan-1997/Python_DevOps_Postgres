   - Select the version that you want to install (e.g., PostgreSQL 14.0) and click on the download link appropriate for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).

2. **Run the Installer**:

   - Once the installer executable file is downloaded, run it by double-clicking on it.

3. **Installation Wizard**:

   - The PostgreSQL Installation Wizard will open. Click "Next" to proceed.

4. **Select Components**:

   - Choose the components you want to install. The default selections are usually sufficient for most users. Click "Next".

5. **Select Installation Directory**:

   - Choose the directory where you want to install PostgreSQL. The default location is usually fine. Click "Next".

6. **Data Directory**:

   - Choose the data directory where PostgreSQL will store its data. The default location is also fine. Click "Next".

7. **Password**:

   - Set a password for the PostgreSQL superuser (called `postgres` by default). Make sure to remember this password, as you'll need it to access the database later. Click "Next".

8. **Port Configuration**:

   - Choose the port number for PostgreSQL. The default port is 5432. Click "Next".

9. **Locale**:

   - Select the locale that matches your system. The default locale is usually fine. Click "Next".

11. **Installation Progress**:

    - The installer will now install PostgreSQL on your system. This may take a few minutes.

12. **Stack Builder** (optional):

    - The Stack Builder is a tool that allows you to download and install additional tools and drivers that work with PostgreSQL. You can skip this for now if you don't need it.

13. **Completing the PostgreSQL Setup**:

    - Once the installation is complete, you'll see a screen indicating the success of the installation. Click "Finish" to close the wizard.
